## About me

I'm a programming student who loves turning ideas into working code. I focus on learning fundamentals, improving through projects, and applying best practices (readable code, tests, and version control). I enjoy combining creativity and technical skills to build small web apps, scripts, and tools that solve real problems.

## Current focus

- Strengthening fundamentals: algorithms, data structures, and design patterns.
- Web development: JavaScript (ES6+), HTML, CSS, and frameworks like React.
- Backend basics: Java / Spring Boot and Node.js / Express.
- Tools & workflows: Git, Docker basics, and unit testing.

## Skills & technologies

**Languages:** JavaScript, Java, Python (learning), HTML, CSS

**Frontend:** React, basic Three.js (exploring), responsive web design

**Backend / Tools:** Node.js, Express, Spring Boot (basic), REST APIs, Git, npm/yarn, Maven

**Databases:** SQLite / PostgreSQL (basic)

**Other:** Linux command line, debugging, writing simple tests, problem-solving

> _Tip:_ This list reflects current learning and projects — expect it to change as I progress.

## Selected projects

> Projects below should link to their repositories. Replace placeholders with repository links and short descriptions.

- **Project A — Todo App** — A responsive todo list with add/edit/remove and local storage. (link: `github.com/<you>/todo-app`)
- **Project B — Portfolio** — A personal portfolio website built with HTML/CSS and React components. (link: `github.com/<you>/portfolio`)
- **Project C — Small API** — Simple RESTful API that stores and retrieves data (Node.js / Express or Spring Boot). (link: `github.com/<you>/simple-api`)


## How to run my projects (example)

```bash
# Clone a project
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo>.git
cd <repo>

# Install dependencies (if Node.js)
npm install

# Run (if Node.js)
npm start
```

*(Each project has its own README with setup instructions.)*

## Learning roadmap

1. Strengthen algorithms & data structures (practice with small problems).
2. Build full-stack projects (connect frontend to backend + database).
3. Learn CI/CD basics and Docker for reproducible environments.
4. Start contributing to OSS small issues and documentation.

## How I work

- I value readable code and small, incremental improvements.
- I commit frequently and write clear commit messages.
- I welcome feedback and contributions — open to pair programming and code reviews.

## Contribution & contact

If you'd like to collaborate or suggest improvements, open an issue or send me a message.

- GitHub: `https://github.com/<your-username>`
- Email: `<your.email@example.com>` (optional)

### Quick tips to personalize this README
- Replace `<Your Name / GitHub Handle>` and all `<>` placeholders with your real info.
- Add direct links to the repositories in **Selected projects**.
- Swap sections or translate to Portuguese if you prefer.
- Add a photo or animated GIF and GitHub badges (shields.io) if you like a more visual header.
